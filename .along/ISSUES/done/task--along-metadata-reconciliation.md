# Release metadata for v1.8.0 / v1.7.2 (CHANGELOG, gate manifest, tags)

Part of the Infomnia root issue `task--along-metadata-reconciliation`: release metadata that the v1.8.0 and v1.7.2
releases skipped. Metadata only, no source changes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `CHANGELOG.md` with 1.8.0 and 1.7.2 entries.
- [x] Gate Execution Manifest in the `2026-10-01--release-v1-8-0` session log, re-verified at `2979886`.
- [x] Retrospective session log for `docs--missing-architectural-features` (`2026-10-01--retro-v1-7-2-docs`).
- [x] Annotated tags `v1.8.0` (`2979886`) and `v1.7.2` (`14857fe`).
- [x] Automated tests passing (node 6/6, react 46/46).
