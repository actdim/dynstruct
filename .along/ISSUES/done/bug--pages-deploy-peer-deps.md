# Bug: Pages deployment fails due to unreleased peer dependencies

## Problem
In standalone CI, `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile` attempts to fetch `@actdim/msgmesh` and `@actdim/utico` >=1.9.0 from npm registry where they are not yet published, failing the docs build.

## Requirements
- Configure pnpm not to auto-install peer dependencies during docs deployment.
- Add `.npmrc` with `auto-install-peers=false` to prevent registry lookups for peer dependencies.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `.github/workflows/pages.yml` updated with `--config.auto-install-peers=false`
- [x] `.npmrc` configured with `auto-install-peers=false`
- [x] Tests and docs build pass
