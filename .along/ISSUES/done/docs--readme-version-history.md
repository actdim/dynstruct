# Docs: version history section in README

`README.md` has no version history. Add a `## Changelog` section (same format as `@actdim/utico`) covering every version from 0.9.0 to the unpublished 1.8.0, derived from git history (`package.json` version per commit) and the actual diffs where commit messages are vague.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `## Changelog` section in `README.md`, newest first, one `### x.y.z (YYYY-MM-DD)` heading per version
- [ ] 1.8.0 includes the StrictMode / `$events` / render-phase sync fixes, `HttpClientError` and the `npm test` runs both suites fix
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` "Earlier versions" points to the README section
- [ ] `__pycache__/` ignored in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Committed and pushed to origin/main
